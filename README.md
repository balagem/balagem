**👋 Hi there, I'm Balaji Santhanam**

I'm a Product Owner with 14+ years of experience driving delivery of AI-enhanced, compliance-driven, and cloud-native platforms across FinTech and public sector environments.

Currently working at Fintech Mortgage company, I lead product delivery for regulated mortgage data pipelines, backlog modernization, and roadmap execution. I specialize in transforming complexity into clean MVPs, automating product workflows with tools like GPT-4 and Copilot, and aligning stakeholder vision with executable delivery.

I care deeply about outcome-driven roadmaps, strategic prioritization, and enabling product teams to ship faster without losing sight of customer value.
